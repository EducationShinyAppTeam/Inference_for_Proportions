    person("Yingjie", "Wang", role = c("aut", "cre")),
    person("Zhuolin", "Luo", role = c("ctb")),

Chapter: Statistical Inference
Description: This app shows how the confidence level and sample size affect the
    outcome confidence interval for a single proportion under the null hypothesis
    of no bias. The app also explores the same issues for a confidence interval
    for the difference between two population proportions.
